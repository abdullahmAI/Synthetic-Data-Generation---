# Synthetic Data Generation for Customer Churn Prediction

This project evaluates the effectiveness of synthetic data generated by a **Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE)** for a customer churn classification task. It compares model performance using original data vs. synthetically generated data using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

## 📊 Overview

- Original dataset: **Bank Customer Churn Dataset** from Kaggle  
- Synthetic generation using: **TVAE** (from SDV library)  
- Evaluation model: **Random Forest**  
- Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:

🔗 **[Bank Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset)**

Download the CSV file and place it in your working directory as:

## 🧠 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Label encoding for categorical variables (`gender`, `country`)  
   - Dropping uninformative columns (`customer_id`)  
   - Train-test split (80/20)

2. **Model 1: Random Forest on Original Data**  
   - Baseline model trained on original customer churn data

3. **Synthetic Data Generation using TVAE**  
   - TVAE is trained on the real dataset  
   - New synthetic samples are generated

4. **Model 2: Random Forest on Synthetic Data**  
   - Same classifier trained on the synthetic data  
   - Evaluation metrics compared to original data

## 📦 Requirements

Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install kaggle sdv scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn torch torchvision torchaudio
To download the dataset programmatically, ensure your kaggle.json is placed correctly:

python

# Place kaggle.json in the current directory, then run:
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
!kaggle datasets download -d gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset
!unzip bank-customer-churn-dataset.zip
```
